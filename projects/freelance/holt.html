      <h3>Holt Security Application</h3>

      <br />
      <h4><u>Overview:</u></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Holt Security has been in business since 2005 and delivers a wide
          range of professional security services such as Static Guarding,
          Mobile Patrol, Digital Security, Loss Prevention, Event Security, Cash
          In Transit among many others.
        </li>
        <li>
          They faced an active problem of keeping logs of the guards which
          caused problems in executing an efficient billing system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created the Android and iOS applications that implemented the
          location-based logging system for the security guards, keeping active
          logs of check-in and check-out times on location basis
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborated with my colleague, Suyash Chandra to develop the
          application and worked closely with the owner of Holt Security, Mr.
          Varun Sharma to deploy the application
        </li>
        <li>
          We used our knowledge of Flutter and Firebase among other technologies
          for the development of this application
        </li>
      </ul>
